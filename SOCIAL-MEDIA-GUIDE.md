```
AI strategy consulting that cuts through the hype. We help organizations find what actually works.
```

**About Section:**

```
Most organizations know AI is important. Fewer know what to actually do about it.

That is where we come in.

Alara Group is an AI strategy consulting firm founded by Cindy G. Levitt and David Levitt. We help midmarket and enterprise organizations cut through the noise of AI hype and find strategies that actually work for their specific situation.

We are not another consulting firm chasing the latest trend. Our approach is grounded in decades of combined experience across insurance, defense, technology, healthcare, and professional services. We have seen what works, what does not, and why most AI initiatives stall before they deliver value.

WHAT WE DO

• AI Strategy Development: Clear roadmaps that connect AI capabilities to business outcomes
• Readiness Assessment: Honest evaluation of where you stand and what it takes to succeed
• Implementation Guidance: Support to keep AI projects on track without overengineering
• Executive Education: Building AI fluency across your leadership team
• Ongoing Advisory: Strategic counsel for organizations navigating continuous AI evolution

HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT

We do not sell technology. We do not have vendor partnerships that bias our recommendations. We work independently so we can tell you what you actually need to hear, not what we want to sell you.

Every organization's AI journey is different. We start by understanding your situation before recommending solutions. If AI is not the right answer for a particular challenge, we will tell you that too.

## Initial Posts

### LinkedIn Launch Post

```
We are officially launching Alara Group Ltd.

After years of watching organizations struggle with AI strategy, we decided to do something about it. Too many companies are either paralyzed by AI hype or rushing into projects that go nowhere.

We are here to help with a different approach:

→ No vendor partnerships biasing our advice
→ Real industry experience (not just tech backgrounds)
→ Focus on what actually works, not what sounds impressive

We work with organizations in insurance, defense, technology, healthcare, and professional services. If you are tired of AI conversations that go in circles, let us talk.

### Facebook Launch Post

```
Excited to announce the launch of Alara Group Ltd!

We help organizations cut through AI hype and find strategies that actually work. No vendor agendas, no buzzword bingo, just practical guidance grounded in real industry experience.

If your organization is trying to figure out what AI can (and cannot) do for you, we would love to start a conversation.

### X (Twitter) Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**

```
We just launched Alara Group Ltd.

Here is why: Most organizations know AI matters. Fewer know what to actually do about it.

We help with that. A thread on what makes us different 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**

```
First: We have no vendor partnerships.

That means when we recommend a path, it is because we think it is right for you. Not because someone is paying us to say it.

Sounds obvious. It is surprisingly rare.
```

**Tweet 3:**

```
Second: We come from your industries.

Insurance, defense, healthcare, tech, professional services. We have worked in these sectors. We understand their constraints.

Generic AI advice is cheap. Industry specific insight is not.
```

**Tweet 4:**

```
Third: We will tell you if AI is not the answer.

Sometimes the best strategy is "not yet" or "not this way." We would rather lose an engagement than give you bad advice.
```

**Tweet 5:**

```
That is the short version.

If you are trying to figure out AI strategy without getting overwhelmed by hype, let us talk.

info@alaragroupltd.com

Or just follow along. We will share what we learn.
