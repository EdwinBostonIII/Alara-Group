# Methodology: ROI Calculation Framework

**Phase:** Strategy / Measurement
**Goal:** Quantify the value of AI investments to justify budget and measure success.

## 1. The Challenge of AI ROI
AI costs are easy to see (licenses, compute). AI value is harder to measure (time saved, quality improved). We use a rigorous framework to estimate both.

## 2. Hard ROI (Direct Financial Impact)

### A. Labor Displacement / Reallocation
*Formula: (Hours Saved per Task × Hourly Rate) × Frequency*

- **Example**:
    - Task: Summarizing claims files.
    - Time: 30 mins -> 5 mins (25 mins saved).
    - Rate: $50/hr.
    - Volume: 1,000 claims/month.
    - **Value**: (25/60 * $50) * 1,000 = ~$20,800/month.

### B. Cost Avoidance
- Reducing reliance on external vendors (e.g., translation services, legal document review).
- Avoiding fines (compliance monitoring).

### C. Revenue Uplift
- Higher conversion rates (faster response to leads).
- Reduced churn (better customer service).

## 3. Soft ROI (Strategic Impact)

We measure these but don't always put a dollar figure on them immediately.
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Reduction in "drudgery" tasks.
- **Speed to Market**: Launching products faster.
- **Consistency**: AI doesn't have "bad days" or get tired.

## 4. The Cost Equation (TCO - Total Cost of Ownership)

ROI = (Value - Cost) / Cost

**Hidden Costs to Include**:
- **Token Costs**: API usage fees (can scale linearly with use).
- **Human Review**: Time spent verifying AI output.
- **Maintenance**: Retraining models, updating prompts.
- **Change Management**: Training time.

## 5. The "Breakeven" Analysis

We calculate:
1.  **Initial Investment**: Setup, consulting, integration.
2.  **Monthly Run Rate**: Licenses, compute.
3.  **Time to Value**: When does cumulative value exceed cumulative cost?

*Rule of Thumb*: A good AI pilot should show positive ROI within 6 months. A transformation program should show it within 12-18 months.
