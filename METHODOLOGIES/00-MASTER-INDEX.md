### <a name="methodology-04"></a>04 - Pilot to Production Playbook

**When to Use:** When ready to build and deploy an AI solution (post-readiness assessment)

**Industry Benchmark vs Alara:**
- Industry: 13% of pilots reach production (Gartner)
- Alara: 87% of pilots reach production

**Why We're Different:**
- Production-first design (no shortcuts in pilot)
- Honest go/no-go decisions (we kill bad pilots early)
- Change management embedded (not bolted on)
- Metrics-driven (every claim backed by data)

**The 4 Phases:**

**Phase 1: The Pilot (6-8 weeks)**
- Scope: ONE use case, ONE user group (15-25 pilot users)
- Success criteria defined upfront (80% acceptance rate, measurable time savings)
- Production-ready architecture from Day 1 (observability, security, scalability)
- Weekly iteration based on feedback

**Phase 2: The Hardening (4-8 weeks, overlaps with late pilot)**
- Performance optimization (latency <3 sec target)
- Cost optimization (model tiering, prompt compression, caching)
- Security hardening (prompt injection defense, PII protection)
- MLOps/LLMOps infrastructure (versioning, A/B testing, rollback capability)

**Phase 3: The Rollout (4-12 weeks)**
- Champion model (1 super user per 20-30 end users)
- Phased rollout strategy (geographic, role-based, or opt-in)
- Training at scale (crawl-walk-run curriculum)
- Support infrastructure (3-tier: self-service, champions, core team)

**Phase 4: Governance & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)**
- Performance monitoring (daily dashboard, weekly reports, monthly reviews)
- Model maintenance (prompt tuning, RAG updates, model upgrades)
- Security & compliance (monthly audits, quarterly pen tests)
- Innovation pipeline (continuous feature development)

**Common Issues & Fixes:**
| Issue | Symptoms | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Hallucinations | Inaccurate outputs | Strengthen RAG, require citations, human-in-loop |
| Low adoption | Users try once, never return | Improve UX, integrate into workflow, re-engagement |
| High costs | $50K+/month AI spend | Model tiering, prompt compression, rate limiting |
| Inconsistent use | Some teams love it, others don't | Customization per role, co-design with low-adoption teams |

**Financial Model:**
- Pilot Investment: $75K-$200K
- Expected ROI: 3-10x in Year 1
- Payback Period: 6-18 months

### <a name="methodology-07"></a>07 - Data Readiness Protocol

**When to Use:** When data quality, accessibility, or compliance is a blocker to AI

**The Brutal Truth:**
- 70% of AI projects fail due to data issues, not algorithm issues (Gartner)
- Data preparation is 80% of AI project work
- Most organizations have "Swamp Data" (messy, siloed, undocumented)

**The 7 Pillars of Data Quality:**
1. **Completeness:** % of required fields populated (target: >95%)
2. **Accuracy:** % matching ground truth (target: >98%)
3. **Consistency:** % following standardized formats (target: >95%)
4. **Timeliness:** Data lag from event to record (target: <24 hours)
5. **Uniqueness:** Duplication rate (target: <2%)
6. **Validity:** % within valid ranges (target: >99%)
7. **Lineage:** % with documented source (target: 100% for regulated, 70% otherwise)

**Remediation Strategies:**

**Strategy A: "Clean House" (Long-Term)**
- Build modern data warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks)
- ETL pipelines for nightly data cleaning
- Timeline: 6-18 months | Investment: $200K-$1M+
- Best For: Organizations with multiple AI use cases planned

**Strategy B: "Wrapper" (Short-Term Agile)**
- AI layer cleans data on-the-fly (e.g., LLM extracts structured data from messy PDFs)
- Timeline: 2-8 weeks | Investment: $20K-$80K
- Best For: Single use case pilot, urgent business need

**Strategy C: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- Phase 1: Wrapper for quick pilot (prove value)
- Phase 2: Selective Clean House for critical data sources
- Phase 3: Continuous improvement (migrate more over time)

**RAG for GenAI:**
- Don't "train" models on client data (expensive, slow, risky)
- "Ground" them via Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Process: Chunking → Embedding → Vector DB indexing → Retrieval at query time
- Vector DB options: Pinecone (SaaS), Weaviate (open source), Qdrant, pgvector

**Data Governance:**
- **Data Owner:** Business leader (defines meaning, sets standards)
- **Data Steward:** Mid-level manager (monitors quality, enforces standards)
- **Data Custodian:** IT/engineering (builds systems, implements controls)
- **Data User:** Analysts, data scientists (use data, report issues)

**Decision Tool: Data Readiness Checklist**
| Criteria | RED (Stop) | YELLOW (Caution) | GREEN (Ready) |
|----------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Volume | <1K samples | 1K-10K | >10K |
| Quality | <70% complete | 70-90% | >90% |
| Access | Manual only | Batch API | Real-time API |
| Legal | No consent | Unclear | Clear consent & DPAs |

**Scoring:**
- 5+ RED → STOP, fix data before AI
- 3-4 RED → Remediation 3-6 months, then pilot
- 0-2 RED, 3+ YELLOW → Agile pilot with wrapper approach
- All GREEN → Proceed to pilot immediately

### <a name="methodology-09"></a>09 - GenAI Prompt Engineering & LLMOps

**When to Use:** Any GenAI project (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

**Key Principle:** Prompts are code. Treat with same rigor as software engineering.

**The 7-Layer Prompt Architecture:**
1. **Role Definition:** "You are an expert [role] with [experience]..."
2. **Task Specification:** "Your task is to [specific action]..."
3. **Context & Constraints:** Rules, boundaries, what NOT to do
4. **Input Data:** Structured format (JSON/YAML), separate user input from system context
5. **Output Format:** JSON schema (force structured output)
6. **Examples (Few-Shot):** 3-5 diverse examples showing expected output
7. **Quality Controls:** Pre-flight checks before LLM responds

**Prompt Engineering Process:**
1. **Week 1:** Requirements gathering (success criteria, failure modes, edge cases)
2. **Week 1:** Baseline prompt (naive V1, test on 20 examples)
3. **Weeks 2-3:** Iterative refinement (test → identify failures → hypothesize fix → A/B test → repeat)
4. **Week 3:** Evaluation framework (100+ example test set, automated + human scoring)
5. **Week 4:** Production deployment (staged rollout, 5% → 50% → 100%)

**Advanced Patterns:**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** For complex reasoning, require step-by-step thinking
- **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting):** For tasks requiring tool use (APIs, databases, calculators)
- **Self-Consistency:** Generate 5-10 responses, take majority vote (for high-stakes decisions)
- **RAG:** Ground responses in specific documents to prevent hallucinations
- **Structured Output:** JSON mode for parsing, data extraction, API integration

**LLMOps Infrastructure:**
- **Observability:** Log every invocation (input, output, latency, cost, user feedback)
- **A/B Testing:** Test prompt variants on 10% traffic, auto-promote winner
- **Drift Detection:** Monitor input/output/performance drift over time
- **Cost Management:** Model tiering (GPT-4o for complex, GPT-4o-mini for simple), caching, prompt compression
- **Security:** Prompt injection defense, PII scanning, audit logs

**Version Control:**
- Store prompts in Git
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Changelog documenting all changes
- Pull request workflow (like code review)

**Cost Optimization:**
```
Example: Claims Letter Drafting
V1: GPT-4, verbose prompt → $0.50/letter
V3: GPT-4o-mini, compressed prompt, caching → $0.08/letter
Savings: 84% cost reduction
At 10K letters/month: $5K/mo → $0.8K/mo = $50K/year savings
```

**Common Issues:**
- Hallucinations → Strengthen grounding, require citations, validation
- Inconsistent outputs → Lower temperature, stricter format, more examples
- Too verbose/terse → Explicit length constraints, examples, token limits
- Ignores instructions → Prioritize key rules, repeat at prompt end, simplify
- Too slow → Compress prompt, reduce output, faster model, caching
- Too expensive → Model tiering, prompt compression, rate limiting

### <a name="methodology-10"></a>10 - Business Process Reengineering

**When to Use:** Legacy process designed for pre-digital era needs complete rethink

**NOT for:** Incremental improvements (use Continuous Improvement / Kaizen instead)

**The Automation Trap (What NOT to Do):**
- Identify slow manual process
- Ask "How can AI automate this?"
- Build AI to replicate existing workflow
- Result: Faster execution of fundamentally flawed process

**The Reengineering Approach:**
- Question every step: Why does this exist? Is it necessary?
- Redesign from scratch: If we built this today with AI, what would it look like?
- Eliminate waste: 7 types (waiting, rework, overprocessing, motion, inventory, transportation, overproduction)
- Then apply AI to reimagined process

**The ESAI Framework (Apply in Order):**
1. **E - Eliminate:** Can we just not do this step?
2. **S - Simplify:** If can't eliminate, can we make it simpler?
3. **A - Automate:** If can't eliminate/simplify, can AI do it?
4. **I - Integrate:** If humans must do it, can we reduce friction?

**5 Phases of Reengineering:**

**Phase 1: Process Mapping (Weeks 1-2)**
- Document current state (as-is): Every step, duration, wait time, error rate, value-add?
- Identify pain points: Red (critical), Yellow (important), Green (minor)

**Phase 2: Reimagine Process (Weeks 3-4)**
- Zero-based thought experiment: Design from scratch with no constraints
- Apply ESAI framework to each step
- Feasibility check: Technical, organizational, financial

**Phase 3: Design New Process (Weeks 5-7)**
- Create detailed process flow (to-be state) with BPMN diagram
- Define AI decision logic (inputs, criteria, outputs, escalation)
- Design human-AI collaboration points (Level 0-3 automation)

**Phase 4: Pilot Redesigned Process (Weeks 8-12)**
- Scope pilot: Single geography/product, 100-500 transactions, 4-8 weeks
- Change management: Communication plan, training, support for impacted roles
- Run pilot and iterate: Weekly metrics review, fix issues, go/no-go decision

**Phase 5: Scale Across Organization (Months 4-12)**
- Phased rollout: Additional geographies, product types
- Continuous improvement: Quarterly process reviews, innovation pipeline

**Industry Playbooks:**

**Insurance Claims:**
- Before: 9 days, 4 hours of work, 95% waiting
- After: 60% instant (AI auto-settle), 30% same-day (human review), 10% traditional
- Avg: 4 hours vs 9 days

**Healthcare Prior Authorization:**
- Before: 5-7 days, 15-25% denial rate, frequent appeals
- After: 75% instant approval, 20% same-day, 5% traditional, 8% denial rate

**Legal Contract Review:**
- Before: 15 days, $15K legal fees
- After: 40% same-day, 50% in 1-2 hours, 10% traditional, avg $2K legal fees

**Expected Results:**
- Cycle time: 50-90%+ reduction
- Cost: 50-90%+ reduction
- Error rate: 70-90% reduction
- Customer satisfaction: 30-50 point NPS improvement
- ROI: 3-10x in Year 1
