# Methodology: Change Management & Culture

**Phase:** Throughout Engagement
**Goal:** Ensure employees embrace AI rather than sabotage it.

---

## 1. The Psychology of AI Adoption

Employees generally fall into three camps:
1.  **The Enthusiasts (10%)**: Using ChatGPT secretly already.
2.  **The Skeptics (70%)**: "Is this going to take my job?" / "I'm too busy for new tools."
3.  **The Resisters (20%)**: Active opposition.

**Strategy**: Leverage the Enthusiasts to convince the Skeptics. Isolate the Resisters.

## 2. The "Augmentation" Narrative

Never pitch AI as "automation" or "cost-cutting" to staff. Pitch it as:
- "Removing the drudgery."
- "Giving you a superpower."
- "Letting you focus on the creative/human parts of the job."

## 3. Training Curriculum

We don't just train on "how to click the buttons." We train on **AI Literacy**.

### Level 1: All Hands (1 Hour)
- What is GenAI? How does it work (predicting the next word)?
- What is it bad at (math, facts, reasoning)?
- Basic ethics and safety.

### Level 2: Power Users (Half Day)
- Prompt Engineering 101 (Context, Instruction, Format).
- How to spot hallucinations.
- Workflow integration.

### Level 3: Leadership (2 Hours)
- How to evaluate AI ROI.
- Managing teams that use AI.
- Legal/Risk implications.

## 4. The "Quick Win" Strategy

To build momentum, the first AI project must:
1.  Solve a **hated** task (e.g., filling out timesheets, summarizing long boring reports).
2.  Be **easy** to use.
3.  Have **zero** risk of job loss.

*Example*: An internal tool that searches all company PDFs and answers questions like "What is our travel policy?" saves everyone time and threatens no one.

## 5. Feedback Channels

Create a "Safe Space" for feedback.
- **"AI Hall of Shame"**: Encourage employees to share funny/bad AI outputs. It demystifies the tech and lowers fear.
- **Bounty Program**: Small rewards ($50 gift card) for finding bugs or suggesting new prompts.
