# Methodology: Strategic Roadmap Development

**Phase:** Strategy
**Goal:** Create a 12-24 month plan that aligns AI initiatives with business goals.

## 1. The "Crawl, Walk, Run" Framework

We never recommend a "Big Bang" implementation. We structure roadmaps in three horizons.

### Horizon 1: Crawl (Months 1-3)
*Goal: Quick Wins & Learning*
- **Focus**: Low risk, high visibility, moderate value.
- **Projects**:
    - Internal Knowledge Base Chatbot (RAG).
    - Meeting Summarization.
    - Marketing Copy Drafting.
- **Tech**: Off-the-shelf tools (SaaS).
- **Governance**: Basic policy establishment.

### Horizon 2: Walk (Months 4-12)
*Goal: Core Business Value*
- **Focus**: Moderate risk, high value, process integration.
- **Projects**:
    - Customer Support Triage.
    - Document Extraction (OCR + LLM).
    - Code Generation for IT.
- **Tech**: API integrations, private instances.
- **Governance**: Formal risk committees, automated monitoring.

### Horizon 3: Run (Months 12-24)
*Goal: Transformation*
- **Focus**: High risk, transformative value, new business models.
- **Projects**:
    - Autonomous Agents.
    - Predictive Decisioning.
    - Personalized Product Creation.
- **Tech**: Fine-tuned models, custom infrastructure.
- **Governance**: Full regulatory compliance audit.

## 2. Prioritization Matrix (The "Impact/Feasibility" Grid)

We plot every potential use case on a 2x2 grid:

- **High Impact / High Feasibility**: **DO NOW** (Horizon 1).
- **High Impact / Low Feasibility**: **PLAN** (Horizon 2/3 - needs data work).
- **Low Impact / High Feasibility**: **FILLERS** (Good for training).
- **Low Impact / Low Feasibility**: **IGNORE**.

## 3. Resource Planning

For each horizon, we define the required resources:
- **Budget**: Software licenses, cloud compute, consulting fees.
- **Talent**: Do we need to hire? Train? Outsource?
- **Data**: What datasets need to be cleaned *now* for Horizon 2?

## 4. The "Living Document" Principle

An AI roadmap is not set in stone. The technology changes too fast.
- **Quarterly Review**: We revisit the roadmap every 3 months.
- **Tech Check**: Has a new model (e.g., GPT-5) made a Horizon 3 idea possible in Horizon 1?
