# Scenario: Copilot Adoption Failure ("We bought it, nobody uses it")

**Category:** Adoption / Change Management
**Trigger:** The CIO spent $30/user/month for Microsoft 365 Copilot for 1,000 employees ($360k/year). Three months later, usage stats show only 5% active users. The CFO wants to cancel.

---

## 1. The Situation
Employees opened Copilot once, tried a generic prompt like "Write me an email", got a mediocre result, and never went back. They treat it as a "gimmick" rather than a tool.

## 2. The Diagnosis
**The "Blank Page" Problem**: Users don't know *what* to ask.
**Lack of Workflow Integration**: They are trying to use it for everything instead of specific high-value tasks.

## 3. The Alara Playbook

### Phase 1: The "Persona" Audit (Week 1)
We don't train everyone the same way. We segment:
- **Sales**: Needs meeting prep and CRM summaries.
- **HR**: Needs policy drafting and candidate comparison.
- **Finance**: Needs Excel formula help and variance analysis.

### Phase 2: The "Prompt Library" Injection (Week 2-3)
We don't just give training; we give *assets*.
- Create a shared "Prompt Library" specific to the company.
- *Example for Sales*: "Analyze this 10-K report for [Prospect] and suggest 3 pain points our product solves."

### Phase 3: The "Copilot Olympics" (Month 1)
Gamify the adoption.
- **Challenge**: "Who can save the most time on a task this week?"
- **Prize**: $500 bonus.
- **Result**: Employees share their best use cases. We capture these and distribute them.

## 4. The "Gotchas"
- **Generic Training**: "Here is how to open the sidebar" is useless. Training must be "Here is how to finish your Friday report in 10 minutes."
- **Data Access Issues**: Sometimes Copilot fails because it *can't* see the files. We fix the SharePoint permissions.
